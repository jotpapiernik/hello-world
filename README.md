# Hello! I'm Tysia! 
I make sense of chaos, design nice and useful apps, merge users' needs with business and developers. I do arts and crafts, especially drawing, illustration, painting, knitting, and sewing. I like running,  wine, Brazilian Portuguese, and salt and vinegar crisps with sour cream. I also write a personal blog http://kotwworku.com.
